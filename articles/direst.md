# Dire Straits
## General 
Dire Straits formed in London in 1977 by Mark Knopfler, David Knopfler, John Illsley and Pick WithersThey were active from 1977 to 1995. Dire Straits' sound drew from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. Dire Straits were called "the biggest British rock band of the 80s" by Classic Rock magazine.

## Brothers in Arms

Brothers in Arms was the first album recorded entirely digitally, because of Knopfler pushing for improved sound quality.
Released in May 1985, Brothers in Arms entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1 and spent a total of 228 weeks in the charts and sold over 4.3 million copies. It went on to become the best-selling album of 1985 in the UK. Brothers in Arms was similarly successful in the US, peaking at No. 1 on Billboard 200 for nine weeks, going multi-platinum and selling nine million copies there. The album spent 34 weeks at number 1 on the Australian ARIA Charts, and it remains the longest-running number one album in Australia.
